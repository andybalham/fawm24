    notes: |
      A random collaboration with Liz (@kahlo2013), where I gave Liz the title and the idea to write about how kindness can be the communication between an owner and a pet. In this case, my cat Luna, adopted last FAWM. Thanks Liz, for bringing the idea to life in such a lovely way. I'm really pleased with how it turned out.
  - title: The Hell Within
    mp3Filename: ab-the-hell-within
    notes: |
      Big thanks to Amanda (@ajna1960) for the lyrics in this random collaboration. I hope you like the interpretation. It went a bit more rock than I originally intended, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my book.
  - title: Rishi And Piers (B.E.T.T.I.N.G.)
    mp3Filename: ab-rishi-and-piers
    notes: |
      Inspired by the odious sight of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68209330">British prime minister betting on sending refugees to unsafe countries</a>. When you think they have stooped as low as possible, they limbo underneath your worst imaginings. 
  - title: No Buzz
    mp3Filename: ab-no-buzz
    notes: |
      A collaboration with Simon Wright (@lyricslinger), who provided the lyrics. To quote Simon, "The world is currently at 90 seconds to midnight according to the Doomsday Clock and it often seems like the sane (or reasonably sane) are left at the mercy of insane world leaders."
