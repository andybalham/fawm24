Ice caps are melting
Forests burn
Sea level rises
Islands are submerged
<p/>
Who can fix this crisis?
Who’s got the means?
That would be us billionaires
But we’ve got other dreams
<p/>
[Chorus]
Hunker in our bunkers
Saved in our caves
Hunker in our bunkers
See out the end of days
Hunker in our bunkers
World above us burns
Emerge into the daylight
Glorious return
<p/>
Don’t look to us to save you
Don’t look to us for hope
We might have built the gallows
But we won’t swing on the rope 
<p/>
You could be lucky to serve us
Collar around your throat
In case you get the idea
Of trying to overthrow
<p/>
[Chorus]
<p/>
When the dust has settled
The billionaires emerge
Peering through the dim light
Of a brave new world
Then realisation
What is the point
Of being the masters
With no one to exploit
