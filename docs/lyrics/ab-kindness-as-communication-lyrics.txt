I find peace…
Watching Luna sleep
Her only pillow is my feet 
Quietly through the night 
She keeps me warm
And I know peace… 
<p/>
I find joy.. 
Seeing Luna play 
Pounces, jumps, and runs
She plays games 
With fingers and shoes 
And I find joy … 
<p/>
With few words 
I’ve earned her trust 
She knows I’ll be there 
As kindness is enough
To communicate care 
<p/>
I find peace…
Hearing Luna purr
As I stroke her fur
Silky and soft
It makes me smile
And I find love…
<p/>
With few words 
I’ve earned her trust 
She knows I’ll be there 
As kindness is enough
To communicate care 
<p/>
Kindness as communication
Brought us here … 
To a love I hold dear
