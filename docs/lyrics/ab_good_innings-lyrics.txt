Here comes Joan with willow in her hands
76 now and in a mighty fine stand
But Boris is bowling, so Joan take your guard
‘Cos the Eton paceman, hits the pitch real hard
<p/>
[Chorus]
You had a good innings, but you’ve been run out
Stranded in the middle on a village shout
Now you won’t get the chance to add to your score
But you had a good innings, who could ask for more?
<p/>
Now Derek’s still out there on 84
The century’s in sight with just a few shots more
But there’s a little chin music and a leg-side field
And the umpire’s finger raised when Boris appeals
<p/>
[Chorus] x2
