(Verse 1)
Tick tock
Tick tock
Here we are with just ninety to go
Hands of time are like a bomb rigged to blow
Still our leaders act like nothing is wrong
Take their hammers and they tap tap on the bomb
Tick tock
Tick tock
<p/>
(Chorus 1)
Enough of listening to fools
Living by their stupid rules
How come the world’s run by mugs
It’s like a nightmare vision on drugs
But I ain't getting no buzz
No buzz
No buzz
<p/>
[Wah-wah ukulele solo]
<p/>
(Verse 2)
Tick tock
Please stop
No plan B with just ninety to go
I see that clock covered in nuclear snow
Still our leaders strut like roosters in the barn
Scratching in the dirt while a fire burns down the farm
Tick tock
Please stop
<p/>
(Chorus 2)
Enough of listening to fools
Living by their stupid rules
How come the sane aren't in power
It’s just mad men in our final hour
And I ain't getting no buzz
No buzz
No buzz
<p/>
