Green pleasant land
Rolls on forever
Landscape of ours
To roam together
<p/>
From wooded hills
To flooded lowlands
We wandered free
In our homeland
<p/>
[Chorus]
This land is ours
This land is ancient
This land is ours
This land was taken
Stolen from us
By an attack
Split up by force
Now we want it back
<p/>
They erected walls
Where there was freedom
They cut us off
With their concealment
<p/>
Now we need to beg
To get permission
For what was ours
Is now forbidden
<p/>
[Chorus]
<p/>
Yes we want it back
We want it back
<p/>
The beauty of the land
For the many not the few
The time is now ripe
For our countryside coup
