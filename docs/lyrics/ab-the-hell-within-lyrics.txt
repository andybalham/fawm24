The uncontrolled spin
Down the dead black hole
The hell within
Absorbs my soul
<p/>
<p/>
The whole world knows I live behind
The dead black hole in my mirror's mind
In my middle aged middle class life I'm dreaming
As my unconscious thoughts die some more
My life's been good at half the price
Apart from the lies, maybe
Apart from the lies
They preach to the wise, as they say
<p/>
The uncontrolled spin
Down the dead black hole
The hell within
Absorbs my soul
The hell within
Absorbs my soul
<p/>
I show the world my bullet-proof skin
But I'm micro-managed by my kin
There's an unbending pre-defined bias to my life
If I kick up a fuss to kiss the wind
There's a taste of what might have been
Apart from the lies, maybe
Apart from the lies
They preach to the wise, as they say
<p/>
The uncontrolled spin
Down the dead black hole
The hell within
Absorbs my soul
The hell within
Absorbs my soul
