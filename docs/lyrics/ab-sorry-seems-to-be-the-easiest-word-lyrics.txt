Oh dear, caught red-handed
We’ve been reprimanded
Looks like we were in the wrong
We’ve been guilty all along
<p/>
Pulled up before the panel
To be grilled for the scandal
Caught by jurisprudence
It’s time to face the music
<p/>
[Chorus]
We’re sorry for this
We’re sorry for that
We’re sorry for getting caught in this trap
Apologies here
Apologies there
Apologies everywhere
‘Cos in the corporate world
Sorry seems to be the easiest word
<p/>
Sit there looking sheepish
As they read the list of breaches
Churn out the apologies
For the company’s policies
<p/>
Offer words, not compensation
Stay loyal to the corporation
Make a sad face, look repentant
Then sidle off to get your pension
<p/>
[Chorus]
<p/>
Polluting rivers, jailing innocent folk
Crocodile tears are all that she wrote
