We all like a wager
We like to bet
Accumulators
Each ways and spreads
<p/>
Counting the throw-ins
Cards and off-sides
Our politicians
Like betting on human lives
<p/>
[Chorus]
Rishi and Piers
Sitting on TV
B.E.T.T.I.N.G.
Rishi and Piers
Happy as can be
Wagering on people’s misery
<p/>
Here's my proposal
Said Piers with an evil grin 
Send ‘em to Rwanda
And a grand you’ll win
<p/>
Before the next election
Get one plane to land
Rishi bent over
And shook him by his hand
<p/>
[Chorus]
<p/>
Now we all like a wager
We all like a punt
We put a few quid on
But we're not all..
<p/>
See you next Tuesday!
