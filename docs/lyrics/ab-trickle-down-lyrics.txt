Prices rising, services cut
Health service creaking, councils going bust
What's the solution, need a quick fix
Here's an idea, give more to the rich
<p/>
[Chorus]
Trickle down, makes me want to throw up
Trickle down, I mean what the f
Tax the rich less, the poor get more
Who the hell do they take us for?
<p/>
Pile up the money, watch it overflow
Drip off the table, to the proles below
See them all waiting, cap in hand
Giving thanks for scraps, from the promised land
<p/>
[Chorus] x2
