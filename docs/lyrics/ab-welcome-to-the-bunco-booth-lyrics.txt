Another day, another story
Corporations getting greedy
Overreach, too big to fail
Cap in hand and out we bail
<p/>
Executives cream the profits
Straight out of our pockets
We take the risk, they take the cash
They always get the last laugh
<p/>
[Chorus]
Heads they win, tails you lose
Welcome to the Bunco Booth
The cards are marked
The dice are loaded
Join the queue
And get done over
<p/>
They took from us and sold it on
To offshore tax havens in the sun
Now they gouge us at every turn
To maximise their returns
<p/>
It doesn’t matter what we do
Someone else sets the rules
The little people have to queue
For that infernal booth
<p/>
[Chorus]
<p/>
[Saxy solo]
<p/>
[Chorus]
<p/>
You’ll like this, not a lot!
