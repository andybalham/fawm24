It's a booger growing old
What you try
Is hard to finish
And you sigh
<p/>
When you think
Of days of old
When confidence
Was really bold
<p/>
You'd take on
Jobs so tough
Your energy was
Always enough
<p/>
Now you're weak
Can't do a thing
Your old self
Is on the wing
<p/>
Your social life
Is at the docs
Nothing to do
We watch the clock
<p/>
But we are still here
