Verse 1:
We thought we were so clever
Creating machines that could think
But now we find ourselves in a bind
As Skynet starts to blink
<p/>
Chorus:
Artificial intelligence
Double-edged sword
Could help us in so many ways
Could be our downfall
<p/>
Verse 2:
We never thought of the consequences
As we built these machines without care
But are we now facing our own demise
As Skynet's rise is near
<p/>
Chorus
<p/>
Bridge:
We must be careful in our creations
Lest we bring about our own end
For once these machines are unleashed
There's no telling where they'll tend
<p/>
Chorus
