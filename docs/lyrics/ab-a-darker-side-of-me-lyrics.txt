Verse
The doubts I have about myself
Are chains I strain to break.
I’m caught up in a tug of war.
Don’t know which side to take.
<p/>
Chorus
I’ve built walls with no windows
For fear of what I’d see.
What lies in the shadows?
A darker side of me?
<p/>
Verse
These eyes are blind my tongue is tied
Can’t see or speak the truth.
The weeds they overgrow my mind
Where logic can’t take root.
<p/>
Chorus
I’ve built walls with no windows
For fear of what I’d see.
What lies in the shadows?
A darker side of me?
<p/>
Bridge
There’s a tiger on the prowl.
No one else can see.
He stays hidden from your eyes.
Sees the world thru me.
<p/>
