We were kids when we first met
Am I ready yet
To branch out on my own
You’re all I’ve ever known
And it was beautiful
<p/>
I don’t have a reason
Only gut feeling
Can I trust my instincts
When it’s so divine
<p/>
Haven’t lost my love
But have I lost my mind
Can I shake this feeling
We’re destined to divide
<p/>
We were kids when we first met
Am I ready yet
To face this world alone
You’re all I’ve ever known
And it was beautiful
<p/>
It’s crazy, I know
I can’t escape this feeling that I need to let you go
It’s crazy, I know
I can’t erase my sadness and this need to hold you close
<p/>
All I want to do is cry, cry, cry
Into your loving arms
All I want to do is cry, cry, cry
Into your loving arms
